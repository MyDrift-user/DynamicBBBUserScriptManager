This is a test for loading the [BBBUserScriptManager](https://github.com/BBBaden-Moodle-userscripts/BBBUserScriptManager) dynamically.

It won't be as efficient as the Original. But it will load the code from the github every time you visit moodle.bbbaden.ch.
Technically speaking, the dynamic loading of code can also be seen as an automatic updater.

I recommend using the Original:
